* Creating Application entities based on the Prometheus [istio](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/adapters/prometheus.html)
and the [redis](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) exporters.  More will be gradually added in the future.
* Collecting app response time and transaction data.  More will be gradually added in the future.

## Prerequisites
* Turbonomic 6.2+ installation
* Kubernetes 1.7.3+
* Install your Prometheus server and supported exporters (as listed above).

## Kubeturbo Installation
* [Deploy Prometurbo](https://github.com/turbonomic/prometurbo/prometurbo/tree/master/deploy)
* Once deployed, corresponding targets will show up in Turbonomic UI
